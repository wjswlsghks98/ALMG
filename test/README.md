# Visualize processed maps with MATLAB
Run test.m to visualize the automatically generated Lanelet Map, which is in OpenStreetMap format. Change the file path to view different maps. MATLAB figures are automatically saved inside the same folder as OSM files.

> ```loadosm.m``` parses OSM file and ```VisualizeMap.m``` uses the parsed information to plot lane marking information and regulatory elements.
